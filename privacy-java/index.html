        <h1>Privacy Policy for CompilerX Java</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 10th July, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to CompilerX Java. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This
            privacy policy explains how we handle your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number. The app only
            processes data that you input within the app for the purpose of compiling Java code.</p>

        <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
        <p>The app may require the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save and load files you create or modify using the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>Our app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain data, including your
            Advertising ID, to serve relevant ads based on your interests.</p>

        <h2>Advertising ID</h2>
        <p>To provide personalized advertisements, Google AdMob may collect and use your device's Advertising ID. This
            identifier helps in serving ads that are more relevant to you. You can opt out of personalized ads in your
            device settings.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal data directly, there is no information used or shared with third parties
            except for advertising purposes through Google AdMob.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app integrates with Google AdMob, which may collect data to provide relevant advertisements. Please refer
            to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Googleâ€™s Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app does not target children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information
            from children. However, advertisements displayed via Google AdMob are subject to their own policies regarding
            child-directed content.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and you are
            advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>
